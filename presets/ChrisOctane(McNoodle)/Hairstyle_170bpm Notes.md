### Hairstyle-170bpm

3 drums, each synthesised with dual voices, summed to mono, modulated with Macro Osc 2 and then sequenced with euclidean pattern generators and gain-staged into a mono to stereo mixer (still a mono signal but with L\&R output).   
The patch demonstrates a parallel mixer technique which works, in this case, as a mixer for one reverb send effect.  
This parallel mixer technique could be modified to act as an effects switch or phase manipulator effect (using phase EQ, signal delay, phase inversions etc.) over the main mixer output, for example.
