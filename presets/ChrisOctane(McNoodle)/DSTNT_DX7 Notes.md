### DISTNT-DX7

A classic digital FM patch synthesised with Disting NT. 

CC24 Wet \- Controls the level of the granulator signal. Level 100 is 0db, 127 drives \+6db into saturation.

CC25 Dry \- The pre-fader level of the dry signal (does not affect effects). Level 100 is 0db, 127 drives \+6db into saturation.

CC26 Brightness \- The synth engine’s filter envelopes open at higher values

CC27 Envelope \- changes mostly the release stages. Longer release both at the top and bottom of the CV range. Central range gives pluckier tones.

CC28 Low Pass Filter \- Cutoff frequency of the filter pair. The filters are placed before the grain effects to allow grains to ring out when you close the filter.

CC29 Key shift \- plays higher or lower notes in the preset scale. 

CC30 Shift Register \- Centre position (64) allows for 100% randomised patterns in both note generators. Moving away from the centre lowers the randomisation amount until 127 or 0 lock in the current patterns to a loop. Note \- due to timing offsets in the shift registers, any ‘locked’ loop will be very long.

This inconspicuous FM bell tone transforms into scary, flying ghost-robots under the following settings:

CC29 127 (pitch up into aliasing)  
CC28 127 (morph up into aliasing)  
CC27 64   
CC26 127 (drives the grain into aliasing, creating robot chatter)  
CC25 0   
CC24 110
